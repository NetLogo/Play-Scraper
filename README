# Play-Scraper

An SBT plugin to enable play sites to be served statically.

## How Do I Use It?
To use, add the following to your `plugins.sbt`
```scala
addSbtPlugin("org.nlogo" % "play-scraper" % "0.1")
```

In your `build.sbt`, add:
```scala
enablePlugins(org.nlogo.Scraper)
scrapeRoutes ++= Seq("/foo", "/bar.js")
```

You will then have access to the `scrapePlay` sbt task, which will scrape the routes specified, plus play assets, and put them in `target/play-scrape`.

## How Do I Build It?

Use sbt. Test it using the `scripted` task.
